TOPIC:
------
* need better subgoal acquiring / achievement detection strategy


TODO:
-----
* control should keep track of steer state and send commands only when
   change necessary
** maybe also rate throttle sending of steering commands
** but also resend if state does not change as desired


** sometimes steer hangs waiting for initial goal



WISHLIST:
---------
* quadtree astar should use a list of goalnodes
** (home is a circle not  a point)
** this is already prepared in astar/3
