TOPIC:
------
* steering should check for necessity of urgent crater/martian/boulder
   avoidance necessity using future_pos
* top level control should count runs and results and adjust our top speed accordingly


TODO:
-----


WISHLIST:
---------
* nice separate control gen_fsm?
** maybe also rate throttle sending of steering commands
** but also resend if state does not change as desired


KNOWN BUGS
----------
* sometimes steer hangs waiting for initial goal
** probably when we find no path, worked around with small minlength
   and heading for {0, 0} after timeout
