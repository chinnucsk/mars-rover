* need better subgoal acquiring / achievement detection strategy


* control should keep track of steer state and send commands only when
   change necessary
** maybe also rate throttle sending of steering commands
** but also resend if state does not change as desired


* need to do proper reset on start of new round
** sometimes steer hangs waiting for initial goal

probably done, but check again:

* quadtree astar should use a list of goalnodes
   (home is a circle not  a point)
