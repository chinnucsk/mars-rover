* control should keep track of steer state and send commands only when
   change necessary
** maybe also rate throttle sending of steering commands

* steer should compute target speed and then accel/brake as needed
** + tuning of the best speed / turning parameters

* need to do proper reset on start of new round
** control should forget about steer state

probably done, but check again:

* proper controller hierarchy

* quadtree astar should use a list of goalnodes
   (home is a circle not  a point)

* steering / speed control:
   deviation to distance ratio should be about 1/5 or below when
   accelerating

* pathfind still same curnode on pos update / quadtree:next_subgoal
   method "could be better"
